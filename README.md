# Ensemble Forecasts of Solar Wind Connectivity to 1 Rs using ADAPT-WSA

This code accompanies the paper (currently in revision), *Ensemble Forecasts of Solar Wind Connectivity to 1 R_s using ADAPT-WSA*, anticipated to be published in the AGU Journal Space Weather in 2023. This code plots a relative probability distribution of source locations for the solar wind at Earth. The source location is where on the surface of the sun the solar wind comes from. The methodology used here builds this relative probability distribution using [Kernel Density Estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) and an ensemble approach powered by the ADAPT-WSA model.
